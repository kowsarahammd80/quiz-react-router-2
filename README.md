My project name is <b>Programing-Quiz-Mailstone</b>. My project is about quiz contest. Here for the project I load data from an api, Than I make some react components to handle data flow easily. First I check user selscted quiz category and load data than I show alerts according to the user answers. Also I use react router in this project.
